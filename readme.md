# ELM UI EXPLORER
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kalutheo/elm-ui-explorer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kalutheo/elm-ui-explorer)

[UI Component Explorers](https://blog.hichroma.com/the-crucial-tool-for-modern-frontend-engineers-fb849b06187a) and [Style Guides](http://styleguides.io/) have been around for a while now.
We don't build pages anymore but components that are assembled together to build systems.

In the Elm world, components are just called views, and are defined as [pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).
Elm UI Explorer takes advantage of the composability and the purity of Elm and offers a way to showcase
your views and their states in a single tool.
Inspired by [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
