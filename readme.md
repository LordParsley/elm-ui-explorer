# ELM UI EXPLORER

[UI Component Explorers](https://blog.hichroma.com/the-crucial-tool-for-modern-frontend-engineers-fb849b06187a) and [Style Guides](http://styleguides.io/) have been around for a while now.
We don't build pages anymore but components that are assembled together to build Systems.

In the ELM world, components are just called views, and are defined as pure functions.
ELM UI Explorer takes advantage of the composability and the purity of ELM and offers a way to showcase
your views and their states in a single tool.
Inspired by [React Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
